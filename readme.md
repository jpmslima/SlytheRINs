# SlytheRINs

## Overview
SlytheRINs is a Python-based application to analyze and compare Residue Interaction Networks (RINs) calculated from different protein structures and conformations. The web-based distribution uses the Streamlit framework and can be accessed at [slytherins.streamlit.app](https://slytherins.streamlit.app). 

SlytheRINs generates interactive plots from [RING](https://ring.biocomputingup.it/)-generated RINs `.edges.txt`files and calculates several graph parameters, for each RIN file. Also, using AlphaMissense output files, SlytheRINs plots the distribution of the possible amino acids changes and their AlphaMissense effect predictions, to facilitate the visualization of each residue importance in the predicted conformational changes.

## Requirements
SlytheRINs requires the following modules:

```
streamlit
pandas
networkx
plotly
scipy
numpy
matplotlib
kaleido
requests
fpdf2
```
>*To download plots as PNG, ensure `kaleido` is installed (`pip install kaleido`). For PDF reports, `fpdf2` is needed (`pip install fpdf2` and ensure DejaVuSans.ttf and its variants are in the script directory). For AlphaMissense download, `requests` is used (`pip install requests`).*

## Input Files
In this first version, SlytheRINs uses the edges output files generated by the application Residue Interaction Network Generator [RING](https://ring.biocomputingup.it/), developed by [Del Conte et al. 2024](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/52/W1/W306/7660079). We are developing a custom RIN generator to integrate in the future versions of SlytheRINs.

RING-generated edges file from multiple models, must be previously splitted to individually describe just one model/structure per `.edges.txt`files. For this you can use shell commands or the included python script `pre-processing.py`.
